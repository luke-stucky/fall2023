This showcases my final project from my first data analytics class.
In this project, I was tasked with performing a comprehensive data analysis using R to explore a dataset and uncover valuable insights. The project involved several key steps, including data wrangling, munging, and preparation using R, followed by the application of statistical and machine learning techniques. I first cleaned and transformed the data, calculated summary statistics, and visualized key relationships using charts and graphs. Next, I employed unsupervised learning through k-means clustering to segment the data, and supervised learning by building a regression model for predictive analysis. Finally, I evaluated the ethical implications of the data and its analysis within the context of the Data Science Code of Conduct. This project was conducted using Quarto (.qmd) for reproducible analysis, and the findings were shared in a client-ready report.
